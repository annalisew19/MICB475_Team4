### What we have done

Proposal Re-submission
- Finished editing it and making changes, just have to hand it in

R portion:
- Phyloseq object rarefaction curve chose: 2500

Qiime2:
- Redid the denoising step using rarefaction parameter: 5000 instead of 10 000
- So likely have to redo R coding that we have already done to take into account new sampling depth
