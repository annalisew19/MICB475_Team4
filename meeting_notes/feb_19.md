## Agenda


### What we have done
R Portion:


Qiime2 Processing:
- 

Proposal:
- Introduction 
- Research question and hypothesis
- Still have to edit these sections


### Questions to ask
Our experimental aims are:
1. Characterize the microbial diversity in the endometrium across different age groups
2. Identify bacterial taxa that are associated with reproductive success or failure
3. Investigate correlations between endometrial microbiota composition and fertilitiy outcomes across age groups
4. Functional analysis of the different microbes composing the microbiomes of different ages and fertility outcomes (potentially take out)


Rough outline of how we plan to achieve each aim (we need some guidance and to work on this more as a group):
1. 
  Qiime process, get into R, histogram to see number of samples for each age and bin by age
  Bin the samples by age (25-30, 35-40, 40-45, 45-50)
  Do taxonomical analysis of the endometrium microbiomes for the binned age groups
  Do alpha diversity analysis to compare the difference in the endometrium microbiome diversity based on age
    IV = age
    DV = endometrial microbiome composition
Visualize: 
2. 
  Within binned age groups, organize into different IVF pregnancy outcomes
  Taxonomic diversity metrics within the pregnancy outcomes
    IV = pregnancy outcome
    DV = endometrial microbiome species present
 Compare the differences in pregnancy outcome and different microbiome compositions
 Visaulize: 
3.
  Pearson or Spearman corrleation between alpha diversity metric (for different ages) and the pregnancy outcome
    IV = alpha diversity of endometrium binned by age (continuous IV)
    DV = pregnancy outcomes
  Visualize:
4.
