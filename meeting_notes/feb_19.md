## Agenda


### What we have done
R Portion:


Qiime2 Processing:
- trained classifer over entire database because many variable regions sequenced by paper
- taxonomic analysis using untrained classifier
- filtered out mitochondria & chloroplast from table
- filtered out NAs is the age column of metadata
- created visualization of ASV stats (omitted mitochondria & chloroplast, no NA age)
- generated tree for phylogenetic diversity analysis
- alpha rarefaction
  1. screenshot of alpha rarefaction curve based on sample (not too sure what sampling depth to use, somewhere between 5000-10000?)
        <img src="../qiime2_files/qiime2view_screenshots/ivf_alpha_rarefaction.png" height="300" width="500">
  2. sampling depth of 10000 (Retained 1,180,000 (36.03%) features in 118 (17.59%) samples at the specifed sampling )

  3. sampling depth of 5000 (Retained 1,025,000 (31.30%) features in 205 (30.55%) samples at the specifed sampling)

Proposal:
- Introduction (rough draft)
- Research question and hypothesis (rough draft)
- Still have to edit these sections


### Questions to ask
Our experimental aims are:
1. Characterize the microbial diversity in the endometrium across different age groups
2. Identify bacterial taxa that are associated with reproductive success or failure
3. Investigate correlations between endometrial microbiota composition and fertilitiy outcomes across age groups
4. Functional analysis of the different microbes composing the microbiomes of different ages and fertility outcomes (potentially take out)


Rough outline of how we plan to achieve each aim (we need some guidance and to work on this more as a group):
