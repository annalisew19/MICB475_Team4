- Random forest modelling:

- some search regarding Streptomyces in endometrium microbiome
  - paper which we obtained data from indicated that Streptomyces is positively correlated to lactobacillus, however only unique to the EF


### Questions to ask/issues
- Should we include beta diversity and ISA results in the manuscript?

### Meeting Notes
- only include Gini plot for random tree in manuscript, mention accuracy %ï¼Œ look into rhodanobacter
- core microbiome a bit too messy, simplify and can resend to evelyn
- find literature to explain the biological phenomenom for Streptomyces
- dont need to do picrust
- 2 types of publication: one with peer review (require extra meeting with editor during the summer), one without
- literature: can mention results from our paper

### Next week

### Future Reference
- Presenting Team 3's research on Tuesday, April 1
- Team 3 presenting our slides on Thursday, April 3
