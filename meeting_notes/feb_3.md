[Paper we got dataset from](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01184-w)

### Potential Topic Questions: 
Age related: diversity of endometrial microbiota across age groups, and if it correlates with fertility outcomes?

Biomaterial provider: data collected from different material providers, may have variation? Can look at if there is difference in microbiota profiles between providers and if it could have affected the studyâ€™s conclusion. 

Other potential questions: the paper mentioned the ethnic distribution: caucasian 57.3%, east asian 14.0%, hispanic 11.4%, others 17.3%. If possible to obtain data for metadata category, could also look at potential differences in microbiota composition in different ethnicities.
